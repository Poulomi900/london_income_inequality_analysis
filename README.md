# Objective of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline on AWS to analyze income inequality trends in the UK. The analysis focuses on understanding the impact of housing costs on disposable income and identifying regional disparities in income distribution. By leveraging AWS services such as S3, Glue, and Athena, this project demonstrates the process of ingesting, transforming, and analyzing data efficiently, with insights that can support financial institutions and policymakers.

## Key Goals
1 Analyze Income Inequality:
  Use the 90:10 income ratio, which compares the income of the top 10% of households (90th percentile) to the bottom 10% (10th percentile), to measure income inequality.
  Examine how inequality varies across regions (London, UK Overall, Rest of the UK) and over time.

2 Assess Housing Costs Impact:
 Compare income levels Before Housing Costs (BHC) and After Housing Costs (AHC).
 Calculate the reduction in disposable income due to housing costs and identify regions where housing affordability is a significant challenge.

3 Provide Actionable Insights:

Derive insights on regional disparities in income inequality to help financial institutions design policies and products targeting areas with high inequality or housing cost burdens.
Identify trends that could guide affordable housing investments or policy interventions.
